# Aviary - Study stochastic parrots in the wild

Go on bird watch right now: [🦜🔍 Aviary 🦜🔍](http://aviary.anyscale.com/)

Aviary is an app that lets you interact with a variety of 
large language models (LLMs) in a single place. 
You can compare the outputs of different models directly, rank them by quality,
get a cost and latency estimate, and more. In particular it offers good support for 
Transformer models hosted on [Hugging Face](http://hf.co) and in many cases also 
supports [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) inference acceleration. 

Aviary is built on top of [Ray](https://ray.io) by [Anyscale](https://anyscale.com).
It's an [open source project](https://github.com/ray-project/aviary), which means
that you can deploy it yourself to a cloud service, 
or simply use our [hosted version](http://aviary.anyscale.com/).
If you would like to use a managed version of Aviary specific to your company,
please [reach out to us](mailto:mwk@anyscale.com).

## Known issues

Aviary is still in early development, and there are a few known issues:

* Latency and throughput are not optimized yet. This is due to the fact that we have
chosen to focus on simplicity and readability for the first release. Ray and Ray Serve
are framework agnostic and Aviary can be easily modified to use FasterTransformer
or other high-performance frameworks. We will continiue working on improving this.
* `lmsys/vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1` model sometimes answers to English questions in Mandarin.
* Replicas which have had a worker failure will continiue to recieve new requests, which
will most likely time out. We are looking into fixing that.

## Future plans

* Streaming support.
* Support for Continuous/Iterative Batching.
* LangChain + LlamaIndex Integration (which will make it much easier to compare open and closed LLMs).
* Better testing.
* Improved documentation.

# Aviary User Guides

For a video introduction, see the following intro. Note: There have been some minor changes since the video was recorded. The guide below is more up to date. 

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/WmqPfQOXJ-4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmqPfQOXJ-4)

## Deploy Aviary 

The guide below walks you through a minimal installation of Aviary for use on an 
Open Source cloud deployment. 

### Set up your laptop

You will need `ray` and `aviary` to be installed on your laptop.

```shell
pip install -U "ray>=2.4.0"
pip install "aviary @ git+https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git"
```


The default Aviary installation only includes the Aviary CLI and SDK.

To install the Aviary UI, use the following commmand. This will
enable you to run the Aviary frontend on your laptop.

```shell
pip install "aviary[frontend] @ git+https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git"
```

### Start a Ray Cluster

Deploy is currently only supported on AWS. 
**Make sure you have exported your AWS credentials locally.**

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
```

Start by cloning this repo to your local machine.

You may need to specify your AWS private key in the `deploy/ray/aviary-cluster.yaml` file.
See [Ray on Cloud VMs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/vms/index.html) page in
Ray documentation for more details.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git
cd aviary

# Start a Ray Cluster (This will take a few minutes to start-up)
ray up deploy/ray/aviary-cluster.yaml
```

### Connect to your Cluster

```shell
# Connect to the Head node of your Ray Cluster (This will take several minutes to autoscale)
ray attach deploy/ray/aviary-cluster.yaml

# Deploy the LightGPT model. 
aviary run --model ./models/amazon--LightGPT.yaml
```

You can deploy any model in the `models` directory of this repo, 
or define your own model YAML file and run that instead.


### Query Aviary

From the head node, run the following commands. 

```shell
export AVIARY_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# List the available models
aviary list_models
amazon/LightGPT

# Query the model
aviary query --model amazon/LightGPT --prompt "How do I make fried rice?"
```
```text
amazon/LightGPT:
To make fried rice, start by heating up some oil in a large pan over medium-high
heat. Once the oil is hot, add your desired amount of vegetables and/or meat to the
pan. Cook until they are lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Add any other
desired ingredients such as eggs, cheese, or sauce to the pan. Finally, stir
everything together and cook for another few minutes until all the ingredients are
cooked through. Serve with your favorite sides and enjoy!
```

You can also use `aviary query` with certain LangChain-compatible APIs.
Currently, we support the following APIs:
* openai (`langchain.llms.OpenAIChat`)

```shell
# langchain is an optional dependency
pip install langchain

export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# Query an Aviary model and OpenAI model
# [PROVIDER]://[MODEL_NAME]
aviary query --model amazon/LightGPT --model openai://gpt-3.5-turbo --prompt "How do I make fried rice?"
```

# Aviary Reference

## Installing Aviary

To install Aviary and its dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
pip install "aviary @ git+https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git"
```

The default Aviary installation only includes the Aviary API client.

Aviary consists of a backend and a frontend, both of which come with additional
dependencies. To install the dependencies for both frontend and backend for local
development, run the following commands:

```shell
pip install "aviary[frontend,backend] @ git+https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git"
```

The backend dependencies are heavy weight, and quite large. We only recommend installing
them on a cluster.

## Running Aviary Frontend locally

Aviary consists of two components, a backend and a frontend.
The backend exposes a FastAPI interface running on a Ray cluster,
that allows you to query various LLMs efficiently.
The frontend is a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) interface that allows you to interact
with the models in the backend through a web interface.
The Gradio app is served using [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html).

To run the Aviary frontend locally, you need to set the following environment variable:

```shell
export AVIARY_HOSTNAME=<hostname of the backend, eg. 'http://localhost:8000'>
```

Once you have set these environment variables, you can run the frontend with the
following command:

```shell
serve run aviary.frontend.app:app
```

To just use the Gradio frontend without Ray Serve, you can start it 
with `python aviary/frontend/app.py`.

If you don't have access to a deployed backend, or would just like to test and develop
the frontend, you can run a mock backend locally by setting `AVIARY_MOCK=True`:

```shell
AVIARY_MOCK=True python aviary/frontend/app.py
```

In any case, the Gradio interface should be accessible at `http://localhost:7860`
in your browser.
If running the frontend yourself is not an option, you can still use 
[our hosted version](http://aviary.anyscale.com/) for your experiments.

### Usage stats collection

Aviary backend collects basic, non-identifiable usage statistics to help us improve the project.
The mechanism for collection is the same as in Ray.
For more information on what is collected and how to opt-out, see the
[Usage Stats Collection](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/usage-stats.html) page in
Ray documentation.

## Using the Aviary CLI

Aviary comes with a CLI that allows you to interact with the backend directly, without
using the Gradio frontend.
Installing Aviary as described earlier will install the `aviary` CLI as well.
You can get a list of all available commands by running `aviary --help`.

Currently, `aviary` supports a few basic commands, all of which can be used with the
`--help` flag to get more information:

```shell
# Get a list of all available models in Aviary
aviary models

# Query a model with a list of prompts
aviary query --model <model-name> --prompt <prompt_1> --prompt <prompt_2>

# Run a query on a text file of prompts
aviary query  --model <model-name> --prompt-file <prompt-file>

# Evaluate the quality of responses with GPT-4 for evaluation
aviary evaluate --input-file <query-result-file>

# Start a new model in Aviary from provided configuration
aviary run <model>
```

### CLI examples

#### Listing all available models

```shell
aviary models
```
```text
mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct
CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta
databricks/dolly-v2-12b
RWKV/rwkv-raven-14b
mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat
stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b
lmsys/vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1
mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter
h2oai/h2ogpt-oasst1-512-12b
OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-7-llama-30b-xor
```

#### Running two models on the same prompt

```shell
aviary query --model mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct --model RWKV/rwkv-raven-14b \
  --prompt "what is love?"
```
```text
mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct:
love can be defined as feeling of affection, attraction or ...
RWKV/rwkv-raven-14b:
Love is a feeling of strong affection and care for someone or something...
```

#### Running a batch-query of two prompts on the same model

```shell
aviary query --model mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct \
  --prompt "what is love?" --prompt "why are we here?"
```

#### Running a query on a text file of prompts

```shell
aviary query --model mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct --prompt-file prompts.txt
```

#### Evaluating the quality of responses with GPT-4 for evaluation

```shell
 aviary evaluate --input-file aviary-output.json --evaluator gpt-4
```

This will result in a leaderboard-like ranking of responses, but also save the
results to file:

```shell
What is the best indie band of the 90s?
                                              Evaluation results (higher ranks are better)                                               
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Model                    ┃ Rank ┃                                                                                            Response ┃

└──────────────────────────┴──────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You can also use the Gradio API directly, by following the instructions
provided in the [Aviary documentation](https://aviary.anyscale.com/?view=api).
